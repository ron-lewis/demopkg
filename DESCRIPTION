Title: A Demo Package for Demostrating R Packages
Version: 0.0.1
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Ron", 
           family = "Lewis", 
           email = "ron.lewis@dfo-mpo.gc.ca", 
           role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package does a something. It's just a demostration package though, so don't expect much. 
  However, I would like to explore what happens with formatting. Did I just create a new paragraph.
    Or does this do it as well?
